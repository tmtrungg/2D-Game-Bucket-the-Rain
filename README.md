# 2D GAME: Bucket the Rain
_Completed in 28/09/2019_

## Game Overview
  This is a PC 2D game that I've created using C++ and free online materials of images.

## How to play
  A bucket was given at the beginning of the game and will be controlled using the left/right arrow keys on the keyboard. Players have to control the bucket to get the blue drops of blue water (normal rain) to increase their score and avoid the purple water (toxic rain) that could take away their scores and end the game (if the player score < 0).
  
  For each score milestone that users reach (10, 20, etc.) the difficulties of the game will be increased in multiple ways (speed up the dropping waters, increase the spawning percentages of purple drops and decrease the blue ones). The game goes on endlessly so that players can break old records and set new ones.
